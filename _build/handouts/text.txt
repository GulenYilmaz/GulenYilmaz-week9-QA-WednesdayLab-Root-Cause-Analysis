Root Cause Analysis

Good news! A new version of Employee Manager is now available to you!
Here we have the new Employee Manager version 1.2 documentation: https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager/1.2_README.html
—-----------------------------------------------
Project Summary
In this project we are building a front end for an employee management system. It should run on any modern browser (post I.E. 8 and similar), and be fully functional, and reasonably styled. Chrome will be our recommended browser. The app can be accessed here.
Current Desired Functionality
The application will load a simulated list of employees, and allow modifications to each. Clicking the employee from the list to the side will bring their file up in the editor. Your employee will consist of:
ID (Whole, positive, and unique number)
Name (1-30 characters long)
Phone (10 digits in length)
Title (1-30 characters long)
All fields except for ID are editable. When saving a change, it will persist as you access other records and navigate back to the desired employee. The save and cancel buttons will only be accessible when modifications have been made, and the cancel button will revert the employee’s file back to the most recently saved version. Every editable field must be populated to save.
Change Log for Version 1.2
Error messages fixed
Can now save after error is presented
Add employee functionality added
Future Functionality
To be aware of, but not currently implemented
Phone numbers will be validated 10 digit, area code included, US phone numbers. e.g. (123)456-7890
The Employee List will reside in a database and be accessed through API integration
An Add Employee function will be implemented
A search function to filter the employee list will be available, based on Job Title, Name, and/or ID
An Email Address field will be added for each employee file
All fields will be required for any entry/modification
Disclosure
This is not an ACTUAL business project - but a project plan to assist Quality Assurance Engineers in their training. Full documentation on the assignment requirements is available in JIRA.

Take the next 30 minutes and compare your previous Employee Manager notes you have and add in any new information you can pull from the documentation.
There may be new features added
Some old issues may have been fixed

Previous Checklist:
Email field for the contact card
Searchable to search the employee list
To be able to log in and out as the user
UI/Interface
Wants for the employee-manager site:
Email field for the contact card
Searchable to search the employee list
To be able to log in and out as the user
Secure database with employee-information
UI/Interface
Some old issues have been fixed:
The Title field must be between 1 and 30 characters long.
The phone number must be 10 digits long.
The cancel button works correctly.
New bugs occured  for the employee-manager site:
Save button works without any  name.



Now take some more time and run some of your previous tests again! We’ll get into why we re-run tests in the future. For now the idea is to make sure the features that were previously working are still continuing to work.
After doing some re-testing and making sure the website is working correctly, make a list of items you would like to see as a user for the Employee Manager.
List of issues/bug’s 
Currently unable to add to the list
Missing Fields
Save button works without any  name.
We do not have a place for Email to be input.
Lack of communication and the client does not know this was a prototype because we did not provide documentation. This could be bad for both the client and our developers; it is certainly a QA issue. 

List of positives:
We have 
ID
Name
Phone→The phone number must be 10 digits long.
And Title→The Title field must be between 1 and 30 characters long.
The cancel button works correctly.


Notes on design/user flow
What features are listed to be added in the docs?
How do you want to see these features implemented?
Some of the issues brought up by the customer in a previous lab were not fully addressed, list out some possible reasons that these issues were not addressed.
Take the next 30 minutes and write out an update to that customer, and how you would take action to address the issues that have not been fixed.
And lastly, write up a report as if it were being sent to a QA manager giving them updates on all the work you’ve done so far for the Employee Manager.
